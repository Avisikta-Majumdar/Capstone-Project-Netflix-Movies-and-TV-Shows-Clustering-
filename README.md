# AlmaBetter Capstone Project 4 - Unsupervised: Netflix Movies And Tv Shows Clustering

## This project is a part of the [Almabetter Pro Program Curriculum(Full Stack Data Science)](https://grow.almabetter.com/auth/signup?referralCode=4M11C2&utm_source=referral)

#### Project Status: [Completed]
####  Score: - [ 100 / 100 ]

## Project Summary :
#### Problem Statement : 
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.<br>
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.<br>
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.<br>
